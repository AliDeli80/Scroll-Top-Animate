## Getting Started

### Clone the Repository:

  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/AliDeli80/Scroll-Top-Animate.git
  ```

## How it Works
1. Scroll Detection: The script monitors the user's scrolling behavior.
2. Button Visibility: A button is dynamically shown or hidden based on the scroll position.
3. Smooth Scrolling: When the button is clicked, the page smoothly scrolls to the top.

## Customization

- Button Style: Modify the CSS in style.css to change the appearance of the button.
- Scroll Duration: Adjust the scrollDuration variable in script.js to control the speed of the scroll animation.
- Trigger Point: Modify the scrollThreshold variable to change the scroll position at which the button appears.

## Bootstrap Integration
This project seamlessly integrates with Bootstrap. Ensure you have Bootstrap's CSS and JavaScript files included in your project. The button's styling and behavior will be consistent with Bootstrap's theme.
